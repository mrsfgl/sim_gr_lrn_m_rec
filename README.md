# Simultaneous Graph Learning and Matrix Recovery

Project repo for SGLMR. See current tasks below. 

## Current Tasks

|Timeline| Task| Details| Related Papers/Links|
|---|---|---|---|
|3.14| Objective, Literature review| Low freq + sparse (high freq?)+ missing data. Write optimization and solve it. Run by Abdullah |
|3.21| Write code and simulate experiments |Experiments on a matrix generated using a Laplacian. Since the task is recovery, can either use gross noise or missing data. |
|3.28| Experiments Continued | Compare against NNFold, RPCA, FRPCAoG, Some NN or GNN based architecture, ?, [Adaptive subsampling](https://github.com/Tgnassou/adaptive_subsampling_multidomain_graph) | [Matrix Completion on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1717) |
|4.4| Real data experiments | __Need to find data.__ | [BCI Competition](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/)|
|4.11| Real Data Experiments | |
|4.18| Theoretical Bounds | Use RPCA, graph stationarity, smoothness, incoherence | [Laplacian Identifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01701), [Joint Inference of...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08120) |
